## Research areas

- Crystal structure databases and associated software development for reproducible science (OPTIMADE).
- Materials and chemical data management for experiment and theory.
- Materials discovery using first principles simulations and surrogate models.
- High-throughput crystal structure prediction with AIRSS, genetic algorithms and related methods.
- Transition-metal phosphides for beyond-Li battery anodes.

## Software

 Most of my software work can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ml-evs).

- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`optimade-python-tools`](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/optimade-python-tools) is a Python library of tools for implementing and consuming [OPTIMADE](www.optimade.org) APIs, which I develop and maintain.
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`OPTIMADE`](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/OPTIMADE) is the specification repository for OPTIMADE, a common REST API for access to materials databases, which I help to develop and maintain. [[7]](https://ml-evs.science/papers.html#7)
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`MODNet`](https://github.com/ppdebreuck/modnet) is a package for materials property prediction focused on small datasets, which I help develop and maintain. [[6]](https://ml-evs.science/papers.html#6)
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`matador`](http://matador.science) is a Python package for the aggregation, standardisation and analysis of the results of first-principles computations, with a focus on battery materials [[5]](https://ml-evs.science/papers.html#5).
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`ilustrado`](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~me388/ilustrado) is a Python package that implements a highly-customisable, massively-parallel genetic algorithm for *ab initio* crystal structure prediction.
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`odbx.science`](http://odbx.science) is a public OPTIMADE API that hosts the Morris group's crystal structures.
