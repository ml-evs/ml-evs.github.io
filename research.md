## Research areas

- Materials discovery using first principles simulations and surrogate models.
- Materials and chemical data management for experiment and theory.
- Crystal structure databases and associated software development for reproducible science ([OPTIMADE](https://optimade.org)).
- High-throughput computational materials science workflows and crystal structure prediction with AIRSS, genetic algorithms and other related methods.
- Transition-metal phosphides for beyond-Li battery anodes.

## Software

 Most of my software work can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ml-evs).

- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`datalab`](https://github.com/the-grey-group/datalab) is a web API and Vue front-end app for materials chemistry data management, tracking samples, devices and their connections, and performing simple analysis of characterisation experiments (XRD, NMR, electrochemistry). It is currently deployed for 6 different groups worldwide.
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`Jobflow-Remote`](https://github.com/matgenix/jobflow-remote) is a distributed high-throughput workflow manager built on top of the [Jobflow](https://github.com/materialsproject/jobflow) library, enabling remote job submission and orchestration.
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`optimade-python-tools`](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/optimade-python-tools) is a Python library of tools for implementing and consuming [OPTIMADE](www.optimade.org) APIs, which I develop and maintain.
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`OPTIMADE`](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/OPTIMADE) is the specification repository for OPTIMADE, a common REST API for access to materials databases, which I help to develop and maintain. [[7]](https://ml-evs.science/papers.html#7)
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`optimade-maker`](https://github.com/materialscloud-org/optimade-maker) is a set of tools for converting static archived data into OPTIMADE APIs; this tool is used in production at the Materials Cloud Archive and was the result of a reserach visit to the Paul Scherer Institut.
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`MaRDA Extractors WG`](https://github.com/marda-alliance/metadata_extractors/): I founded and co-lead a [MaRDA](https://www.marda-alliance.org/) working group (open to all!) on the topic of metadata extractors for materials science and chemistry, see the [schemas](https://marda-alliance.github.io/metadata_extractors_schema) and [registry](https://marda-registry.fly.dev/).
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`MODNet`](https://github.com/ppdebreuck/modnet) is a package for materials property prediction focused on small datasets, which I help develop and maintain. [[6]](https://ml-evs.science/papers.html#6)
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`matador`](http://matador.science) is a Python package for the aggregation, standardisation and analysis of the results of first-principles computations, with a focus on battery materials [[5]](https://ml-evs.science/papers.html#5).
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`ilustrado`](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~me388/ilustrado) is a Python package that implements a highly-customisable, massively-parallel genetic algorithm for *ab initio* crystal structure prediction.
- [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`odbx.science`](http://odbx.science) is a public OPTIMADE API that hosts the Morris group's crystal structures and an increasing number of materials discovery datasets [[misc](https://optimade-misc.odbx.science)], [[GNoME](https://optimade-gnome.odbx.science)] and [thismaterialdoesnotexist.com](https://thismaterialdoesnotexis.com).

I additionally help to maintain several other open source projects, including
[<i class="fab fa-github"></i>`galvani`](https://github.com/echemdata/galvani)
(parsing battery file formats in Python), [<i class="fab
fa-github"></i>`matminer`](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer)
(materials machine learning in Python), [<i class="fab
fa-github"></i>`PASCal`](https://github.com/MJCliffe/PASCal) (fitting of *in situ*
diffraction strain data [[11]](https://ml-evs.science/papers.html#11), as well as making frequent contributions
to upstream packages in the field.
