I am [BEWARE research fellow](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/847587) in the group of [Prof Gian-Marco Rignanese](https://perso.uclouvain.be/gian-marco.rignanese/) at UCLouvain, working on high-throughput workflows and machine learning for computational materials discovery and design.
As a [BIG-MAP "stakeholder"](https://www.big-map.eu/big-map/projects-from-1st-stakeholder-initiative), I also develop software and infrastructure for experimental data management as a visitor in the group of [Prof Clare Grey](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/grey/index) at the University of Cambridge.

My CV is available at [ml-evs.science/cv](https://ml-evs.science/cv) and most of my software work can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ml-evs).
